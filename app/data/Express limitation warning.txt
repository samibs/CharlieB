Features Supported by the Editions of SQL Server 2012Starting with SQL Server 2012, these memory limits are enforced only for the database cache (buffer pool). 
The rest of the caches in the SQL Server memory manager can use much more memory than is specified by these edition limits. 
For example, a SQL Server 2012 Express edition can use only a maximum size of 1.4 GB for its database cache. 
Other caches (such as the procedure cache, the metadata cache, and so on) can consume memory up to the size specified by the "max server memory" configuration.
